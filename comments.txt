PythonLaunchDescription is not needed because IncludeLaunchDescription can load python launch files

ddrive_rviz.launch launches robot_state_publisher as does ddrive.launch.py so it would be better to just use ddrive_rviz.launch.py to do that and include it in the launchfile (I suspect that you may actually be launching two robot_state_publishers)
